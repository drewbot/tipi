#TIPI
###The Interactive Project Initiator

TIPI was built in ember.js using firebase SDK. It's purpose is to help expedite the project initiation process. When contacted about a potential project users can keep their documentation organized and templated through initial questionnaire research and through writing a proposal, contract and brief.

##How it works:

> Users fill out a questionnaire or share one with a client when inquired about a new web development project. The responses to the questionnaire, when saved, will create a new project model instance to be tracked through review and publishing.
>
> Edit a project planner based on the responses in the review queue. Share unique links with stakeholders during the review process that pertain to their project only. 2-way data binding allows for real-time remote oversight without browser refresh. Save to firebase.
>
> Publish a custom proposal, contract and brief containing pertinent info taken from the created project model and based on [Eric Dodd's The Little Freelancer](https://github.com/ericdodds/the-little-freelancer) open source guide.

##Next Steps:
> Convert Git auth into email/username auth.
> Export a brief into Basecamp via api.
> User testing
